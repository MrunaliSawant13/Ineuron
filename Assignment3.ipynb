    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANS: Function has following advantages:\n",
    "    1) It divides code into modules\n",
    "    2) It improves readability\n",
    "    3) It allows reusability\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The code in function will run when the function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The 'def' keyword following the 'function name' will create a function. \n",
    "     For example:\n",
    "         def new_function():\n",
    "            print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "        This will create a function named 'new_function'\n",
    "        *******************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Function contains the part of code that performs some operations to give certain output. \n",
    "     Whereas, Function call will ask to execute the code of function at given point of time.Unless a function is called there is no use of that function.\n",
    "     ********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: There is one global scope in python program. Local scope is created as and when function is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: When the function call returns, the local scope variables are forgotten and thus the local scope is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The return value is the value sent by function to the function caller. Yes, it is possible to have a return valu in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: When there is no return statement, the return value of a call to that function is None.\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: We can make a function variable refer to the global variable by using global statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Data typr of None is NoneType\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: The sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic imports the module nameareallyourpetsnamederic.\n",

    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: it can be called as spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Use try clause\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Try clause is used for the statements/code that can cause error\n",
    "    and except clause is used to give message if error occurs\n",
    "    \n",
